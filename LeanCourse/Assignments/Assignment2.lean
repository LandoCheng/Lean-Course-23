section Surjectivity

/- Lean's mathematical library knows what a surjective function is, but let's define it here
ourselves and prove some things about it. -/
def SurjectiveFunction (f : ℝ → ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ (y : ℝ), ∃ (x : ℝ), f x = y

variable {f g : ℝ → ℝ} {x : ℝ}

/- `rfl` or `simp` can compute the following.
  `simp` is a very useful tactic that can simplify many expressions. -/
example : (g ∘ f) x = g (f x) := by simp

lemma exercise2_2 (h : SurjectiveFunction (g ∘ f)) : SurjectiveFunction g := by {
  intro y
  specialize h y
  obtain ⟨x₀,h₀⟩ := h
  simp at h₀
  use f x₀
}

/- Hint: you are allowed to use the previous exercise in this exercise! -/
lemma exercise2_3 (hf : SurjectiveFunction f) :
    SurjectiveFunction (g ∘ f) ↔ SurjectiveFunction g := by {
  constructor
  · intro hc
    apply exercise2_2 hc
  · intro h
    intro z
    specialize h z
    obtain ⟨y,h₁⟩ := h
    specialize hf y
    obtain ⟨x,h₂⟩ := hf
    rw [← h₂] at h₁
    simp
    use x
}

/- Composing a surjective function by a linear function to the left and the right will still result
in a surjective function. The `ring` tactic will be very useful here! -/
lemma exercise2_4 (hf : SurjectiveFunction f) :
    SurjectiveFunction (fun x ↦ 2 * f (3 * (x + 4)) + 1) := by {
  intro z
  specialize hf ((z-1)/2)
  obtain ⟨y,h₁⟩ := hf
  use ((y/3)-4)
  ring
  rw [h₁]
  ring
}

end Surjectivity





section Growth

/- Given two sequences of natural numbers `s` and `t`. We say that `s` eventually grows faster than
  `t` if for all `k : ℕ`, `s_n` will be at least as large as `k * t_n` for large enough `n`. -/
def EventuallyGrowsFaster (s t : ℕ → ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ k : ℕ, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, k * t n ≤ s n

variable {s t : ℕ → ℕ} {k : ℕ}

/- Hint: `simp` can help you simplify expressions like the following.
  Furthermore, `gcongr` will be helpful! -/
example : (fun n ↦ n * s n) k = k * s k := by simp

lemma exercise2_5 : EventuallyGrowsFaster (fun n ↦ n * s n) s := by {
  intro k
  use k
  intro n h₀
  simp
  gcongr
}

/- For the following exercise, it will be useful to know that you can write `max a b`
  to take the maximum of `a` and `b`, and that this lemma holds  -/
lemma useful_fact (a b c : ℕ) : c ≥ max a b ↔ c ≥ a ∧ c ≥ b := by simp

lemma exercise2_6 {s₁ s₂ t₁ t₂ : ℕ → ℕ}
    (h₁ : EventuallyGrowsFaster s₁ t₁) (h₂ : EventuallyGrowsFaster s₂ t₂) :
    EventuallyGrowsFaster (s₁ + s₂) (t₁ + t₂) := by {
  intro k
  specialize h₁ k
  obtain ⟨N₁,pre₁⟩ := h₁
  specialize h₂ k
  obtain ⟨N₂,pre₂⟩ := h₂
  use max N₁ N₂
  intro n h
  simp at h
  specialize pre₁ n h.1
  specialize pre₂ n h.2
  simp
  rw [mul_add]
  gcongr
}


/- Optional hard exercise 1:
Find a function that is nowhere zero and grows faster than itself when shifted by one. -/
lemma exercise2_7 : ∃ (s : ℕ → ℕ), EventuallyGrowsFaster (fun n ↦ s (n+1)) s ∧ ∀ n, s n ≠ 0 := by
sorry


/- Optional hard exercise 2:
Show that a function that satisfies the conditions of the last
exercise, then it must necessarily tend to infinity.
The following fact will be useful. Also, the first step of the proof is already given. -/

lemma useful_fact2 {n m : ℕ} (hn : n ≥ m + 1) : ∃ k ≥ m, k + 1 = n := by
  use n - 1
  constructor
  · exact?
  · have : 1 ≤ n := by exact?
    exact?

lemma exercise2_8 (hs : EventuallyGrowsFaster (fun n ↦ s (n+1)) s) (h2s : ∀ n, s n ≠ 0) :
  ∀ k : ℕ, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, s n ≥ k := by
  have h3s : ∀ n, 1 ≤ s n := by
    intro n
    exact?
  sorry
